Breakdown of data sent:

``` time ``` -> On startup, the Pixal queries once from NTP servers and sets its RTC with this information. Subsequent time information do not query from NTP but uses the MicroPython RTC functionality.

``` meanTemperature ``` -> We did several calculations of the temperature measurement delay of the TMP 007. Decided on measuring the average temperature over a 2.5 second interval for each pixel scan

``` rgb ``` -> Using a temperature to RGB algorithm as detailed in main.py, we create a range of rgb values from raw temperature data gathered from the TMP 007

# Effective modifications

<3d printed cube, aluminium foil,ultrasonic sensor to measure distance>
The field-of-view of the sensor is limited by enclosing it with a IR shielded enclosure with a small aperture. The measurements of the enclosure is calculated and tabulated in the table below:

![alt tag](https://github.com/Jiantastic/embed-trio-IoT/blob/master/images/Enclosure_Calculation.png)

The customised enclosure is then 3D printed.

# Future Work

Additional sensors will be implemented on the Pixal in the future. This includes a HC-SR04 ultrasonic range sensor.
This will enable more accurate determination of the heat source using triangulation algorithms. Additiional sensor data, such as distance of the object from the sensor can also be collected.

Relays and actuators can also be added according to the end applications. 
For example, actuators can be used to turn on fans for warmer areas to improve ventilation.

## Ideas

Provisional ideas:

* PIR motion, IR sensors:  thermal imaging

* smart desk for IR and PIR: HVAC personalised desk ecosystem

0. Various Applications of Thermopiles: http://www.jondetech.com/documents/applications.html

1. Infrared shower body temperature detector - modifies shower temperature based on how cold the human body is

2. Detect number of humans in the area ( do humans emit infrared at a certain wavelength? We can just filter for that particular wavelength) - intruder alarms use passive IR iirc, can use that as a reference

3. Camera/PIR sensor + TMP007(measure object temperature) to achieve something like this -> http://www.flir.co.uk/flirone/ios-android/ (we just need to map temperatures of a certain range to a certain colour to achieve this) . If we have two cameras, we can use triangulation to determine how far the object is from our sensors. All these data can be processed in the "cloud" and visualised onto a webpage. 

  <strong>PROBLEM : is TMP007 capable of getting a range of heat values or just one? if it's just one we wouldn't be able to create a   heat map</strong>
  => operating temp range: -40 to 125 degree celcius and it's within the thermal imaging color scale 
  
  <strong>BUSINESS PROPOSITION : Current infrared camera solutions are expensive, what we have here is a 30ish pound IoT device. Able to deploy these sensors in a forest to record the frequency of movement of animals in a certain locations. As the GPS coordinates of sensors have already been determined via an on-board GPS chip, we can visualise where animals move around in the forest and at what times, useful for scientific research etc etc...</strong>
  
  converting temperature (K) to RGB : https://gist.github.com/paulkaplan/5184275
  
4. Motion detection based on change in temperature

5. Victim Detection robot after Earthquakes like this -> https://www.uni-koblenz.de/~agas/Public/Hahn2011HMF.pdf 

6. At times of epidemics of diseases causing fever, such as SARS coronavirus and Ebola virus disease, non contact IR sensor can be used to check arriving travellers for fever.

7. Able to set a temperature threshold for TMP 007. Sends an ALERT signal if exceed certain threshold (for example). Can be used to detect change/specific objects (human body at 37C?)
8. Smart fever monitoring system: Parents can visualise the body temperature/fever condition of their kids (even when they are away from home etc) through cloud connected smart phone application which records and send alert notification if the value exceeds a certain threshold level.
